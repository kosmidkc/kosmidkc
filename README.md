### Hi there 👋

My name is Kostas, a civil engineer from Greece 🇬🇷 turned self-taught data analyst in Czech Republic 🇨🇿

🔭 I'm currently working as a data analyst at Showmax, a streaming company in South Africa 

🌱 At the moment, I am trying to improve my skills on Python and SQL  

👯 I am looking to collaborate on data analytics and data science projects. Interested in learning about AI and machine learning 

💬 You can ask me about tips on how to get into data analytics from an engineering background
