### Hi there 👋

My name is Kostas, a civil engineer turned self-taught data analyst  

🔭 I'm currently working as a data analyst in the insurance industry and will soon transition to software engineer in a tech company 

🌱 At the moment, I am trying to improve my skills on Python and SQL and trying to become familiar with Github  

👯 I am looking to collaborate on data analytics and data science projects. Interested in learning about AI and machine learning 

💬 You can ask me about tips on how to get into data analytics from an engineering background  

📫 You can reach me at my Linkedin profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosmidkc/

Outside of work, I like hiking, watching movies, reading books, and finding new restaurants
